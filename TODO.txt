Pre-requisites
1. Binary search algorithm
first=0
last=len(arr)-1
run a loop till first is less than last
usually mid is first +last//2
but due to indexing after mid will have issues 
mid = (last-first )+first//2

if number found return number
after mid if number to find > mid :number lies after mid+1

so set first to mid 
otherwise set last to mid
