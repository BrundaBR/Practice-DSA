# Bitwise operations

& -if both 1 then 1 or 0

| - if any 1 then 1 ,if both 0 then 0

XOR - if both have same val then ,if both val are diff then 1
example of xor-a^ 0=a



# Shifts:
1. Left shift << 
--when we do left shift by 1 then we are multipliying 2
2. Right shift >>
--right shift by 1 then Dividing by 2


## if number is occuring odd number of times then it will return the number.

## if number is occuring is even number of times then will return 0.
